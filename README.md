The Heilongjiang Road Damage Dataset (HLJRDD) was independently collected by our research team, covering highway projects such as the Harbin-Daqing Expressway, Harbin Ring Expressway, and areas in ShangZhi City, TongHe County, and JiaMusi City. Data collection was performed using high-resolution industrial cameras mounted on dedicated vehicles, with an image resolution of 4080Ã—2544 pixels. Fig 3 shows the overall configuration of our data collection system. This dataset contains images captured under various real-world road conditions, including normal lighting, shadowed environments, and wet areas, totaling 15,000 images. Of these, 12,000 images were used for model training, and 3,000 images were used for testing and validation. 

This is a partial display of the complete dataset. Once our article is published, the entire dataset will be presented.
